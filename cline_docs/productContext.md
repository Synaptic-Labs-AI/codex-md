3. **Formatting Preservation**: Maintaining proper formatting, tables, lists, and other structural elements during conversion is challenging.

4. **Offline Accessibility**: Many conversion tools require internet connectivity, limiting usage in offline environments.

5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Users need a solution that works consistently across different operating systems.
