- [ ] Move audio/video services
- [ ] Update service references
- [ ] Standardize on CommonJS

### Phase 3: IPC Integration (2-3 days)
- [ ] Create IPC type definitions
- [ ] Create handler registry
- [ ] Implement specific handlers
- [ ] Update main process
- [ ] Update frontend integration
- [ ] Implement security hardening

### Phase 4: Cleanup (1-2 days)
- [ ] Remove backend directory
- [x] Update project configuration
- [x] Update documentation

- [x] Fix NSIS icon format error
- [ ] Clean up code
- [ ] Run final verification

## Known Issues

### Active Issues

2. ESM vs CommonJS module system conflicts:
   - Causing production issues
   - Affects URL conversion particularly
   - Being addressed by consolidation plan

3. Complex three-component architecture:
   - Frontend, Backend, Electron separation causing issues
   - Will be simplified to two components
   - Migration plan in place

4. Duplicate code and utilities:
   - Found across components
   - Will be consolidated during migration
   - Single source of truth being established

5. File locking issues during builds:
   - Affects Windows particularly
   - Build process improvements planned
   - Will be simplified after consolidation

### Resolved Issues
- ~~API key persistence issue across application restarts~~ (Fixed - modified storeFactory.js to handle undefined/empty encryption keys properly)
- ~~Audio files incorrectly routed to OCR converter~~ (Fixed - added special handling in UnifiedConverterFactory.js for multimedia files)
- ~~Missing validateApiKey method in ApiKeyService~~ (Fixed - implemented method with proper error handling)
- ~~Application startup failure / TypeError: OpenAIProxyService is not a constructor errors~~ (Fixed - Reverted lazy loading. Changed OpenAIProxyService to export `{ instance }` and updated consumers to import via destructuring as a potential workaround for build/packaging issues.)
- ~~OpenAI API not configured / TypeError: OpenAIProxyService is not a constructor errors~~ (Fixed - Implemented singleton pattern for OpenAIProxyService, TranscriberService, FileStorageService, FileProcessorService and updated consumers like main.js, apikey.js, ConverterRegistry.js to use shared instances)
- ~~OpenAI API "Configuration is not a constructor" error~~ (Fixed - updated OpenAIProxyService.js to use OpenAI v4 API syntax instead of v3)
- ~~Audio conversion "spawn ffmpeg.exe ENOENT" error~~ (Fixed - corrected ffmpeg path configuration in AudioConverter)
- ~~Audio transcription "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'sender')" error~~ (Fixed - added check for null event in TranscriberService)
- ~~Audio transcription "uuid is not a function" error~~ (Fixed - corrected uuid import and usage in TranscriberService)
- ~~Mistral OCR API error handling~~ (Fixed - improved error handling for non-JSON responses in MistralPdfConverter)
- ~~Mistral OCR 500 Internal Server Error~~ (Fixed - updated API integration with correct endpoint, request format, and model parameter)
- ~~Mistral OCR 422 Unprocessable Entity Error~~ (Fixed - implemented correct file upload workflow using /files and /ocr endpoints)
- ~~Video conversion "Conversion tracking object not found" error~~ (Fixed - Refactored VideoConverter and ConverterRegistry to use a single, central tracking map in the registry, resolving issues caused by separate internal tracking maps and incorrect instance handling)
| | - ~~Video conversion "Conversion produced empty content" error~~ (Fixed - Implemented BinaryPathResolver module and refactored VideoConverter.js to use it, ensuring reliable FFmpeg binary resolution across all environments)
| | - ~~Video conversion log pattern confusion~~ (Clarified - Documented the multi-stage conversion process that shows both failure and success messages as expected behavior)
- ~~Navigation bar missing in final build~~ (Fixed)
- ~~Asset loading issues~~ (Fixed)
- ~~PDF conversion errors~~ (Fixed)
- ~~Performance issues with large files~~ (Fixed)
- ~~UI responsiveness during conversion~~ (Fixed)
- ~~NSIS memory mapping error during Windows installer creation~~ (Fixed)
- ~~NSIS icon format error during Windows installer creation~~ (Fixed)
- ~~CSV converter initialization failure in production build~~ (Fixed)
- ~~Converter initialization failure due to missing node-cache dependency~~ (Fixed)
- ~~Multiple dependency-related failures in production build~~ (Fixed - moved axios, axios-retry, canvas, formdata-node, and tmp-promise to runtime dependencies)
- ~~False positive dependency warnings for built-in Node.js modules~~ (Fixed - enhanced verification script)
| - ~~FFmpeg binary detection in packaged application~~ (Fixed - Implemented comprehensive solution with BinaryPathResolver module and VideoConverter.js refactoring to handle ASAR archive incompatibility)

- ~~Video conversion failing due to incorrect output path handling~~ (Fixed [2025-04-24] - Modified VideoConverter.js to retrieve output path from registry within `processConversion` method, ensuring user-specified directory is used)
- ~~Video conversion `Assignment to constant variable` error~~ (Fixed [2025-04-24] - Modified VideoConverter.js to declare `outputPath` with `let` instead of `const`, allowing reassignment when needed)
