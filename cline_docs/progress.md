# Progress

## What Works
- Basic application functionality
- File conversion features
- User interface and navigation
- Cross-platform compatibility (macOS)
- Development mode functionality

## What's Left to Build
- Improved error handling for edge cases
- Enhanced offline functionality
- Additional file format support
- Performance optimizations

## Current Status
- **Fixed**: Asset loading issues in Windows production builds
  - Implemented enhanced protocol handlers with Windows-specific path handling
  - Added ASAR-aware path resolution for packaged apps
  - Improved static asset management with verification and fallbacks
  - Enhanced error handling and recovery mechanisms

- **Fixed**: Static asset loading in packaged application
  - Created copy-static-assets.js script to copy static assets during build
  - Enhanced afterPack.js to verify and copy static assets if missing
  - Added extraResources configuration to ensure static assets are included
  - Implemented multiple fallback mechanisms for asset loading

- **Fixed**: Build process file locking issues on Windows
  - Created dedicated app-icon.png file separate from logo.png
  - Created dedicated favicon-icon.png file separate from favicon.png
  - Updated package.json and afterPack.js to use the dedicated icon files
  - Enhanced copy-static-assets.js with retry logic for file locking
  - Created cleanup-resources.js script to ensure no file handles are open
  - Added prebuild:electron script to run cleanup before electron-builder

- **Fixed**: SvelteKit asset loading in installed application
  - Enhanced file protocol handler to correctly handle SvelteKit asset paths
  - Added special case for _app/immutable path pattern used in newer SvelteKit builds
  - Improved path extraction for different SvelteKit asset path formats
  - Added special case for direct file requests with no path
  - Enhanced logging for better debugging of asset loading issues

- **In Progress**: Testing and validation of the build process improvements
  - Need to verify on different Windows environments
  - Need to ensure compatibility with macOS builds
  - Need to document the solution for future reference

## Known Issues
- ~~Asset loading failures in Windows production builds~~ (Fixed)
- ~~File locking issues with logo.png during Windows builds~~ (Fixed)
- ~~File locking issues with favicon.png during Windows builds~~ (Fixed)
- ~~SvelteKit asset loading failures in installed application~~ (Fixed)
- Some static assets may not be properly loaded in certain edge cases
- Error handling could be improved for better user feedback
- Need to ensure proper cleanup of resources when the app is closed

## Next Steps

### Short-term Actions
1. Complete testing of the build process improvements
2. Document the solution in the system patterns
3. Implement automated tests for the build process

### Long-term Strategy: SvelteKit to Plain Svelte Migration
We've developed a comprehensive migration plan to address the root causes of our asset loading and file locking issues by transitioning from SvelteKit to plain Svelte + Vite. This plan is documented in:

- [Migration Summary](migration-summary.md) - Overview of the migration plan
- [Phase 1: Convert SvelteKit to Plain Svelte + Vite](migration-phase1.md)
- [Phase 2: Refactor Core Components and Stores](migration-phase2.md)
- [Phase 3: Update Electron Integration](migration-phase3.md)
- [Phase 4: Testing and Validation](migration-phase4.md)
- [Phase 5: Optimization and Cleanup](migration-phase5.md)

This migration will provide several key benefits:
- **Simplified Asset Loading**: Relative paths that work reliably with Electron's file:// protocol
- **Reduced Complexity**: Removal of unnecessary server-side code and middleware
- **Optimized for Electron**: Build process tailored specifically for Electron
- **Improved Maintainability**: More straightforward codebase that's easier to maintain

The migration is designed to be implemented incrementally, with each phase building on the previous one. This approach minimizes risk and allows for validation at each step.
