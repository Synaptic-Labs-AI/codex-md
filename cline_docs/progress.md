8. ~~Fix video conversion "PathUtils.toPlatformPath is not a function" error~~ (Done)
   - Removed calls to non-existent `PathUtils.toPlatformPath()` method in transcriber.js
   - Used direct path variables instead, which were already normalized earlier in the function
   - Simplified ffmpeg input/output path handling
9. Implement automated tests for the build process
10. Apply similar build process optimizations to other Electron projects

### Long-term Strategy: SvelteKit to Plain Svelte Migration
We've developed a comprehensive migration plan to address the root causes of our asset loading and file locking issues by transitioning from SvelteKit to plain Svelte + Vite. This plan is documented in:

- [Migration Summary](migration-summary.md) - Overview of the migration plan
- [Phase 1: Convert SvelteKit to Plain Svelte + Vite](migration-phase1.md)
- [Phase 2: Refactor Core Components and Stores](migration-phase2.md)
- [Phase 3: Update Electron Integration](migration-phase3.md)
- [Phase 4: Testing and Validation](migration-phase4.md)
- [Phase 5: Optimization and Cleanup](migration-phase5.md)

This migration will provide several key benefits:
- **Simplified Asset Loading**: Relative paths that work reliably with Electron's file:// protocol
- **Reduced Complexity**: Removal of unnecessary server-side code and middleware
- **Optimized for Electron**: Build process tailored specifically for Electron
- **Improved Maintainability**: More straightforward codebase that's easier to maintain

The migration is designed to be implemented incrementally, with each phase building on the previous one. This approach minimizes risk and allows for validation at each step.
