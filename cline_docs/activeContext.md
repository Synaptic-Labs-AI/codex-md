# Active Context

## Current Focus
Fixing build process issues in the Electron app on Windows, specifically addressing file locking problems that prevent successful packaging. This is a critical issue that prevents the application from being built properly in production.

## Recent Changes

### Electron Asset Loading Fix (2025-04-08)
- Reverted to standard file:// protocol with enhanced Windows-specific handling
- Modified SvelteKit configuration to use relative paths (relative: true)
- Enhanced the file:// protocol handler with proper ASAR-aware path resolution
- Added special handling for static assets and SvelteKit-generated files
- Implemented fallback mechanisms with delayed retries for loading the app

### Static Asset Management Fix (2025-04-08)
- Created copy-static-assets.js script to copy static assets to dist directory
- Enhanced afterPack.js to verify and copy static assets if missing
- Added extraResources configuration to ensure static assets are included in the packaged app
- Implemented multiple fallback mechanisms for asset loading
- Fixed script path in package.json to correctly reference the copy-static-assets.js script
- Updated copy-static-assets.js to handle being called from different directories

### Build Process Improvements (2025-04-08)
- Created dedicated app-icon.png file to separate application icon from UI assets
- Created dedicated favicon-icon.png file to separate favicon from UI assets
- Updated package.json to use the dedicated icon files instead of shared assets
- Enhanced copy-static-assets.js with retry logic for file locking issues
- Created cleanup-resources.js script to ensure no file handles are open before build
- Added prebuild:electron script to run cleanup before electron-builder
- Modified make script to include cleanup step for Windows builds

### Asset Path Resolution Fix (2025-04-08)
- Enhanced file protocol handler to correctly handle SvelteKit asset paths
- Added special case for _app/immutable path pattern used in newer SvelteKit builds
- Improved path extraction for different SvelteKit asset path formats
- Added special case for direct file requests with no path
- Enhanced logging for better debugging of asset loading issues

### Related Changes
- Updated the build process to ensure proper asset paths in production
- Added more comprehensive error logging for debugging asset loading issues
- Improved path normalization utilities to handle Windows-specific path formats

## Current Issues
- ~~The app was failing to load JavaScript assets in production mode~~ (Fixed)
- ~~Build process was failing with EBUSY errors when copying static assets~~ (Fixed)
- ~~The installed application was failing to load SvelteKit assets~~ (Fixed)
- ~~The build process was encountering file locking issues with logo.png~~ (Fixed)
- ~~The build process was encountering file locking issues with favicon.png~~ (Fixed)
- The build process was encountering file locking issues on Windows:
  ```
  тип EBUSY: resource busy or locked, copyfile 'C:\Users\jrose\Documents\codex-md\frontend\static\logo.png' -> 'C:\Users\jrose\Documents\codex-md\dist\win-unpacked\resources\frontend\static\logo.png'
  ```
- This was caused by static assets being used for multiple purposes (UI, app icons, etc.)
- The issue specifically affects Windows due to its stricter file locking behavior

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Test the build process with the new improvements on Windows
2. Verify that the application builds successfully without file locking errors
3. Document the solution in the system patterns for future reference

### Long-term Solution: Migration to Plain Svelte + Vite
We've created a comprehensive migration plan to address the root cause of the asset loading issues by transitioning from SvelteKit to plain Svelte + Vite. This plan is documented in:

- [Migration Summary](migration-summary.md) - Overview of the migration plan
- [Phase 1: Convert SvelteKit to Plain Svelte + Vite](migration-phase1.md)
- [Phase 2: Refactor Core Components and Stores](migration-phase2.md)
- [Phase 3: Update Electron Integration](migration-phase3.md)
- [Phase 4: Testing and Validation](migration-phase4.md)
- [Phase 5: Optimization and Cleanup](migration-phase5.md)

The migration will:
- Simplify asset loading with relative paths that work reliably with Electron
- Remove unnecessary server-side code and middleware
- Optimize the build process specifically for Electron
- Create a more maintainable codebase

This approach addresses the root cause of the file locking and asset loading issues rather than just treating the symptoms.
