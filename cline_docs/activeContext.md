# Active Context

## Current Focus
Enhancing the converter architecture to improve maintainability, reduce redundancy, and fix URL conversion issues. This work aims to create a more robust and standardized approach to file conversion throughout the application.

## Recent Changes

- Enhanced cleanup-resources.js with exponential backoff retry logic for locked files
- Improved afterPack.js to safely verify assets without causing file locks
- Removed manual copy-static-assets.js step from the build process
- Let electron-builder handle asset copying through a single extraResources configuration

### Electron Asset Loading Fix (2025-04-08)
- Reverted to standard file:// protocol with enhanced Windows-specific handling
- Modified SvelteKit configuration to use relative paths (relative: true)
- Enhanced the file:// protocol handler with proper ASAR-aware path resolution
- Added special handling for static assets and SvelteKit-generated files
- Implemented fallback mechanisms with delayed retries for loading the app

### Static Asset Management Fix (2025-04-08)
- Created copy-static-assets.js script to copy static assets to dist directory
- Enhanced afterPack.js to verify and copy static assets if missing
- Added extraResources configuration to ensure static assets are included in the packaged app
- Implemented multiple fallback mechanisms for asset loading
- Fixed script path in package.json to correctly reference the copy-static-assets.js script
- Updated copy-static-assets.js to handle being called from different directories

### Build Process Improvements (2025-04-08)
- Created dedicated app-icon.png file to separate application icon from UI assets
- Created dedicated favicon-icon.png file to separate favicon from UI assets
- Updated package.json to use the dedicated icon files instead of shared assets
- Enhanced copy-static-assets.js with retry logic for file locking issues
- Created cleanup-resources.js script to ensure no file handles are open before build
- Added prebuild:electron script to run cleanup before electron-builder
- Modified make script to include cleanup step for Windows builds

### Asset Path Resolution Fix (2025-04-08)
- Enhanced file protocol handler to correctly handle SvelteKit asset paths
- Added special case for _app/immutable path pattern used in newer SvelteKit builds
- Improved path extraction for different SvelteKit asset path formats
- Added special case for direct file requests with no path
- Enhanced logging for better debugging of asset loading issues

### Related Changes
- Updated the build process to ensure proper asset paths in production
- Added more comprehensive error logging for debugging asset loading issues
- Improved path normalization utilities to handle Windows-specific path formats

### Navigation Bar Fix (2025-04-08)
- Fixed missing navigation bar in the final Electron build
- Added Navigation component import and usage to App.svelte
- Updated Logo component to use relative path for logo image
- Ensured proper asset loading in production builds

## Current Issues
- ~~The app was failing to load JavaScript assets in production mode~~ (Fixed)
- ~~Build process was failing with EBUSY errors when copying static assets~~ (Fixed)
- ~~The installed application was failing to load SvelteKit assets~~ (Fixed)
- ~~The build process was encountering file locking issues with logo.png~~ (Fixed)
- ~~The build process was encountering file locking issues with favicon.png~~ (Fixed)
- ~~The build process was encountering file locking issues on Windows~~ (Fixed):
  ```
  ⨯ EBUSY: resource busy or locked, copyfile 'C:\Users\jrose\Documents\codex-md\frontend\static\favicon-icon.png' -> 'C:\Users\jrose\Documents\codex-md\dist\win-unpacked\resources\frontend\dist\static\favicon-icon.png'
  ```
- ~~This was caused by static assets being used for multiple purposes (UI, app icons, etc.)~~ (Fixed)
- ~~The issue specifically affects Windows due to its stricter file locking behavior~~ (Fixed)
- ~~Navigation bar missing in the final Electron build~~ (Fixed)
- ~~URL conversion failing with "Unsupported file type: ai" error~~ (Fixed)
- ~~URL conversion failing with "converter.convert is not a function" error~~ (Fixed)
- ~~Advanced OCR not being used despite OCR being enabled and Mistral API key being present~~ (Fixed)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ~~Test the build process with the new improvements on Windows~~ (Completed)
2. ~~Verify that the application builds successfully without file locking errors~~ (Completed)
3. ~~Fix URL conversion to properly handle URLs without treating them as files~~ (Completed)
4. ~~Fix path validation for URL-based filenames~~ (Completed)
  - Added isUrl option to path validation in PathUtils
  - Updated FileSystemService to handle URL paths properly
  - Updated ConversionResultManager to pass isUrl flag
  - Fixed illegal characters check for URL filenames
  - Improved error messages to show specific invalid characters
  - Eliminated duplicate sanitizeFileName method to reduce confusion
5. Document the solution in the system patterns for future reference
6. Consider implementing similar improvements in other Electron projects

### Long-term Solution: Migration to Plain Svelte + Vite
We've created a comprehensive migration plan to address the root cause of the asset loading issues by transitioning from SvelteKit to plain Svelte + Vite. This plan is documented in:

- [Migration Summary](migration-summary.md) - Overview of the migration plan
- [Phase 1: Convert SvelteKit to Plain Svelte + Vite](migration-phase1.md)
- [Phase 2: Refactor Core Components and Stores](migration-phase2.md)
- [Phase 3: Update Electron Integration](migration-phase3.md)
- [Phase 4: Testing and Validation](migration-phase4.md)
- [Phase 5: Optimization and Cleanup](migration-phase5.md)

The migration will:
- Simplify asset loading with relative paths that work reliably with Electron
- Remove unnecessary server-side code and middleware
- Optimize the build process specifically for Electron
- Create a more maintainable codebase

This approach addresses the root cause of the file locking and asset loading issues rather than just treating the symptoms.
