# Active Context

## Current Focus
Enhanced batch conversion with improved temporary file handling and buffer conversion:
- Fixed "Path does not exist or access denied" errors in temporary file cleanup
- Fixed "Invalid PDF: Expected a buffer" and "Invalid PPTX: Expected a buffer" errors
- Fixed "Worker exited with code null" error in URL conversion
- Implemented robust temporary file lifecycle management
- Enhanced buffer handling for binary files in worker process
- Improved error handling and recovery in batch conversion

Previous Focus:
Fixed batch conversion issues with URL, PPTX, and PDF files:
- Fixed "converter.convert is not a function" error in URL conversion
- Fixed "No converter available for type: pptx" error in PPTX conversion
- Fixed "Invalid input: Expected a buffer" error in PDF conversion
- Enhanced converter module loading and error handling in worker process
- Improved buffer type detection and conversion in batch processing


Earlier Focus:
Transitioning to Phase 4: Desktop Features - Implementing system tray integration, native notifications, file associations, and auto-updates while enhancing frontend components for native file operations and completing the IPC implementation for all conversion types.

- Implementing a standardized attachment folder structure for images extracted from PDFs and slides
- Enhancing URL and Parent URL conversion with Puppeteer for better content extraction

## Recent Changes

- Enhanced Temporary File Handling and Buffer Conversion:
  - Implemented a temporary file registry to track file status and metadata
  - Added robust retry logic with exponential backoff for file operations
  - Enhanced buffer conversion with specialized handling for PDF and PPTX files
  - Improved error handling and validation in file operations
  - Added proper sequencing between file creation, use, and cleanup
  - Implemented delayed cleanup to ensure worker processes are done with files
  - Fixed serialization issues with binary data in worker processes

- Fixed Batch Conversion URL, PPTX, and PDF Issues:
  - Enhanced conversion-worker.js to directly use specialized adapters for URL, PPTX, and PDF conversions
  - Improved URL and parentURL converter adapters to handle multiple export formats
  - Added robust module loading with fallbacks for different export patterns
  - Enhanced Buffer type detection and conversion in worker process
  - Added comprehensive error handling and validation in converter adapters
  - Improved logging for better diagnostics and troubleshooting
  - Fixed serialization issues that were causing Buffer type loss

- Implemented File-Based Image Transfer System:
  - Added workerImageTransfer.js utility module to handle image transfers between processes
  - Modified worker script to save images to temp files before sending results
  - Updated WorkerManager to convert file paths back to image buffers after transfer
  - Implemented proper cleanup of temporary image files
  - Fixed "Invalid string length" error in batch conversions by avoiding large data serialization
  - Enhanced image handling in both Mistral OCR and standard PDF conversion

- Simplified Batch Output Organization:
  - Removed category-based folder organization
  - All files now write directly to batch output directory
  - Added automatic handling of filename collisions with numeric suffixes
  - Maintained core batch conversion functionality while reducing complexity
