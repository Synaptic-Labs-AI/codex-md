# Shared Package Restructuring Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to restructure the project by eliminating the shared package dependency and moving utilities directly into the frontend, electron, and backend components.

## Overview

The current architecture uses a shared package for common utilities, but this has led to module system mismatches between development and production environments, causing errors like "fileType is not defined" when converting URLs in production.

## Implementation Phases

The restructuring will be implemented in the following phases:

1. [Phase 1: Analysis and Preparation](./shared-restructuring-phase1.md)
2. [Phase 2: Frontend Implementation](./shared-restructuring-phase2.md)
3. [Phase 3: Electron Implementation](./shared-restructuring-phase3.md)
4. [Phase 4: Backend Implementation](./shared-restructuring-phase4.md)
5. [Phase 5: Update Import Paths](./shared-restructuring-phase5.md)
6. [Phase 6: Clean Up and Testing](./shared-restructuring-phase6.md)

## Expected Outcome

After implementing this restructuring:

1. The shared package dependency will be eliminated
2. Each component (frontend, electron, backend) will have its own copy of the utilities it needs
3. Module system mismatches will be resolved
4. URL conversion and other functionality will work correctly in production builds

## Risks and Mitigation

1. **Code Duplication**:
   - Risk: Multiple copies of the same code could lead to maintenance issues
   - Mitigation: Clear documentation and consistent naming conventions

2. **Inconsistent Behavior**:
   - Risk: Different implementations might behave differently
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing across all environments

3. **Build Process Complexity**:
   - Risk: Removing shared package might complicate the build process
   - Mitigation: Update build scripts to be simpler and more direct
