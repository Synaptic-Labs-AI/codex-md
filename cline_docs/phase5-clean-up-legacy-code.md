   - Updated DropZone component to remove size checks

2. **Cleaned Up Legacy Code**
   - Removed commented-out YouTube functionality
   - Removed legacy status mappings from unifiedConversion.js
   - Removed redundant getFileIconFullConfig utility
   - Simplified batchUpdate method

3. **Improved Documentation**
   - Updated progress tracking
   - Documented changes in code
   - Maintained clear interfaces and comments

4. **Verified Changes**
   - Confirmed all functionality still works
   - Tested file uploads and conversions
   - Validated type checking still works correctly
   - Ensured no regressions in UI

## Files to Change/Delete

### Files to Analyze:
- All utility files in `frontend/src/lib/utils/`
- All store files in `frontend/src/lib/stores/`
- All service files in `frontend/src/lib/services/` and `src/electron/services/`
- All converter files in `backend/src/services/converter/`
- All component files in `frontend/src/lib/components/`

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Identify Unused Utilities

First, we need to identify utilities that are no longer referenced or used in the codebase:

#### Actions:
1. Use code search tools to find references to utility functions
2. Check for deprecated functions that have been replaced
3. Create a list of unused or redundant utilities

```bash
# Commands to find references (for reference)
grep -r "import.*from.*utils/" frontend/src/
grep -r "functionName" --include="*.js" --include="*.svelte" frontend/src/
```

Example analysis table:
| Function | File | Used? | References | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|------------|-------|
| `formatDate` | `utils/dateUtils.js` | Yes | 12 files | Keep |
| `oldFormatDate` | `utils/dateUtils.js` | No | 0 files | Remove - deprecated |
| `convertToMarkdown` | `utils/legacyConverter.js` | No | 0 files | Remove - replaced by new converter system |

4. Document all functions identified for removal
5. Check for any side effects or dependencies before removal

### 2. Analyze Import Statements

Review import statements throughout the codebase to identify unused imports:

#### Actions:
1. Look for imports that are never used in the file
2. Check for unused exports in utility files
3. Identify circular dependencies that can be simplified

```javascript
// Example of unused imports to remove
// Before:
import { func1, func2, func3, func4 } from '../utils/helpers';
// But only func1 and func3 are actually used

// After:
import { func1, func3 } from '../utils/helpers';
```

4. Create a list of files with unused imports
5. Document the changes needed for each file

### 3. Remove Dead Code

Remove functions, variables, and code blocks that are never called or used:

#### Actions:
1. Remove unused utility functions identified in step 1
2. Delete unused variables and imports identified in step 2
3. Remove redundant error handling or logging code

```javascript
// Example of dead code removal
// Before:
function processData(data) {
  // This function is used
  return data.map(item => item.value);
}

function formatDataLegacy(data) {
  // This function is never called anywhere
  return data.join(',');
}

// After:
function processData(data) {
  return data.map(item => item.value);
}
```

4. Remove commented-out code blocks that are no longer relevant
5. Delete unused CSS classes and styles
6. Test after each significant removal to ensure functionality is preserved

### 4. Consolidate Similar Functions

Identify and consolidate functions with similar purposes across different files:

#### Actions:
1. Look for functions that perform similar operations in different files
2. Analyze their implementations and determine the most robust version
3. Consolidate them into a single, well-documented function

```javascript
// Example of function consolidation
// Before (in fileUtils.js):
export function getFileExtension(filename) {
  return filename.slice(filename.lastIndexOf('.'));
}

// Before (in pathUtils.js):
export function extractExtension(path) {
  const filename = path.split('/').pop();
  return filename.includes('.') ? filename.split('.').pop() : '';
}

// After (consolidated in fileUtils.js):
/**
 * Gets the file extension from a filename or path
 * @param {string} filePathOrName - The file path or name
 * @param {boolean} includeDot - Whether to include the dot in the extension
 * @returns {string} The file extension
 */
export function getFileExtension(filePathOrName, includeDot = true) {
  const filename = filePathOrName.split(/[\/\\]/).pop();
  if (!filename.includes('.')) return '';
  
  const extension = includeDot 
    ? filename.slice(filename.lastIndexOf('.'))
    : filename.split('.').pop();
    
  return extension;
}
```

5. Update all references to use the consolidated function
6. Add clear documentation for the consolidated function
7. Test thoroughly to ensure all use cases are covered

### 5. Clean Up Comments

Update comments throughout the codebase to ensure they are accurate and helpful:

#### Actions:
1. Remove outdated or incorrect comments
2. Update comments to reflect current functionality
3. Ensure JSDoc comments are accurate and complete

```javascript
// Example of comment cleanup
// Before:
// This function converts the file to PDF
// TODO: Add support for images
function convertToPdf(file) {
  // Implementation
}

// After:
/**
 * Converts a document file to PDF format
 * @param {File} file - The file to convert
 * @returns {Promise<Buffer>} The converted PDF as a buffer
 */
function convertToPdf(file) {
  // Implementation
}
```

4. Remove TODO comments for features that have been implemented
5. Add TODO comments for legitimate future improvements
6. Ensure comments follow a consistent style

### 6. Remove Unused Components

Identify and remove any unused UI components:

#### Actions:
1. Search for component imports throughout the codebase
2. Check for components that are imported but never rendered
3. Look for components that have been replaced by newer versions

```bash
# Command to find component imports (for reference)
grep -r "import.*from.*components/" frontend/src/
```

4. Create a list of components identified for removal
5. Check for any CSS or assets used exclusively by these components
6. Remove the components and their associated files

### 7. Clean Up Store Files

Review store files to remove unused or redundant stores:

#### Actions:
1. Identify stores that are no longer used in the application
2. Look for stores with overlapping functionality
3. Consolidate similar stores where appropriate

```javascript
// Example of store cleanup
// Before (in unusedStore.js):
import { writable } from 'svelte/store';
export const unusedStore = writable(null);

// Before (in index.js):
export { unusedStore } from './unusedStore';

// After:
// Remove unusedStore.js completely
// Remove the export from index.js
```

4. Ensure proper cleanup of store subscriptions in components
5. Test to verify no functionality is broken by store changes

### 8. Test After Each Removal

Test the application thoroughly after each significant code removal:

#### Actions:
1. Run the application in development mode
2. Test all major features and workflows
3. Check the console for any errors
4. Verify that UI components render correctly
5. Test edge cases that might be affected by the changes

### 9. Document Changes

Update documentation to reflect the code cleanup:

#### Actions:
1. Update `progress.md` to document the removed code
2. Add notes about consolidated functions and their new locations
3. Document any changes to component or store architecture
4. Update any diagrams or flowcharts to reflect the streamlined codebase

## Risk Mitigation

To ensure we don't break existing functionality:

1. **Incremental Changes**: Make small, focused changes that can be tested individually
2. **Thorough Testing**: Test after each significant removal
3. **Backup Original Files**: Keep backups of original files before making significant changes
4. **Version Control**: Commit changes frequently with clear messages
5. **Logging**: Add temporary logging to help diagnose any issues
6. **Rollback Plan**: Be prepared to revert changes if issues are discovered

## Success Criteria

- No unused or dead code remains in the codebase
- Similar functions are consolidated into well-documented utilities
- Comments are accurate and helpful
- No errors or warnings in the console
- All features continue to work correctly
- Code complexity metrics show improvement
- Documentation accurately reflects the current state of the codebase
