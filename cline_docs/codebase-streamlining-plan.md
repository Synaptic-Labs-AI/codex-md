# Codebase Streamlining Plan for Codex MD

## Overall Goal

The primary goal of this streamlining plan is to reduce complexity, remove redundant code, eliminate unused components, and improve maintainability of the Codex MD application while preserving all core functionality. This will make the codebase easier to maintain, extend, and understand for new developers.

## Implementation Approach

To ensure we don't break existing functionality, we'll follow these principles:

1. **Incremental Changes**: Make small, focused changes that can be tested individually
2. **Thorough Testing**: Test each change before moving to the next step
3. **Preserve Core Functionality**: Ensure all file conversion capabilities remain intact
4. **Maintain Offline Support**: Preserve offline functionality for non-API dependent converters
5. **Clear Documentation**: Document all changes and the reasoning behind them

## Phase 1: Remove Unused Components âœ“

### Goal (Completed)
Remove unused UI components and related stores to reduce codebase size and complexity.

### Implementation Summary
Successfully removed unused components and verified application functionality:

1. **Removed Components**:
   - Deleted `frontend/src/lib/components/ProfessorSynapseAd.svelte`
   - Deleted `frontend/src/lib/components/settings/OcrSettings.svelte`

2. **Store Analysis**:
   - Confirmed no `adStore.js` existed in the codebase
   - Verified no references to removed components in store files

3. **OCR Settings Migration**:
   - Confirmed OCR functionality is now handled through unified Settings interface
   - Settings.svelte already implements modern OCR configuration with:
     - Toggle component for enabling/disabling
     - Direct store integration via settings store
     - Mistral OCR configuration UI

4. **Verification**:
   - No references to removed components found in codebase
   - Application loads and functions correctly
   - OCR settings remain fully functional through new implementation

### Results
- Reduced codebase complexity by removing unused components
- Simplified component structure for better maintainability
- Maintained all core functionality while reducing technical debt
- Successfully documented changes in progress.md

## Phase 2: Consolidate File Handling Utilities

### Goal
Standardize on a single approach to file handling by consolidating overlapping utilities and establishing `FileSystemService` as the primary file handling service.

### Files to Change/Delete

#### Files to Modify:
- `src/electron/services/FileSystemService.js` (primary file handling service)
- `frontend/src/lib/utils/filehandler.js` (consolidate into FileSystemService)
- `frontend/src/lib/utils/conversion/handlers/tempFileManager.js` (consolidate into FileSystemService)
- `frontend/src/lib/utils/conversion/handlers/downloadHandler.js` (consolidate into FileSystemService)

#### Files to Update References:
- Any files importing from the above utilities

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Analyze File Handling Utilities**
   - Review each file handling utility to identify unique functionality
   - Create a list of functions in each utility and their purpose
   - Identify overlapping functionality
   - Determine which functions should be preserved and which can be consolidated

2. **Enhance FileSystemService**
   - Add any unique functionality from other utilities to `FileSystemService.js`
   - Ensure proper error handling and logging
   - Maintain consistent parameter naming and return values
   - Add JSDoc comments for all functions

3. **Create Adapter Functions**
   - In each utility file, create adapter functions that call the corresponding `FileSystemService` methods
   - This allows for a gradual transition without breaking existing code
   - Example:

   ```javascript
   // In filehandler.js
   import FileSystemService from 'path/to/FileSystemService';

   // Original function (now an adapter)
   export async function readFile(path) {
     console.warn('filehandler.readFile is deprecated. Use FileSystemService.readFile instead.');
     return await FileSystemService.readFile(path);
   }
   ```

4. **Update References Gradually**
   - Identify files that import from the utilities being consolidated
   - Update imports to use `FileSystemService` directly
   - Test each change to ensure functionality is preserved

5. **Add Deprecation Notices**
   - Add deprecation notices to the adapter functions
   - Document that these functions will be removed in a future version
   - Provide migration guidance

6. **Test File Operations**
   - Test all file operations to ensure they work correctly
   - Verify error handling works as expected
   - Check that all file types can be processed correctly

## Phase 3: Optimize PDF Converters

   - Ensure error handling is consistent

   ```javascript
   // Example of removing commented-out code
   // Remove this block:
   /*
   async extractImagesWithFallback(pdfBuffer, originalName) {
     // ... commented out code
   }
   */
   
   // Add clear documentation:
   /**
    * Standard PDF converter for text extraction.
    * Note: This converter does not extract images. For image extraction,
    * use MistralPdfConverter with OCR enabled.
    */
   ```

2. **Refine BasePdfConverter**
   - Review `BasePdfConverter.js` to ensure it contains only truly shared functionality
