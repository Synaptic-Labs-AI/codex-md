# Batch Converter Fix Plan

## UI Simplification for Single File Conversion

We've simplified the UI to support only single file conversion by:

1. Removing checkboxes and multi-selection functionality from the file list
2. Hiding both the URL input and drop zone once either a file or URL is added
3. Re-revealing both input options when the file is deleted
4. Commenting out multi-selection methods in the files store

### Components Modified

1. **FileCard.svelte**
   - Removed checkbox for file selection
   - Removed selection-related styling and functionality
   - Kept the delete button for removing individual files

2. **FileList.svelte**
   - Removed "Check All" and "Delete Selected" buttons
   - Removed selection-related event handlers
   - Ensured it dispatches events when files are removed

3. **FileUploader.svelte**
   - Modified to hide both input options (URL input and drop zone) when a file/URL is added
   - Added logic to re-reveal both input options when the file is deleted
   - Simplified the UI to focus on single file conversion

4. **files.js Store**
   - Commented out methods related to file selection (toggleSelect, selectAll, getSelectedFiles)
   - Added documentation to explain the changes
   - Kept the existing logic that replaces all files with just the new one

### Future Considerations

- If batch conversion functionality is needed in the future, we can uncomment the selection methods in the files store
- The UI components would need to be updated to restore the checkboxes and selection actions

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to temporarily disable batch conversion functionality and modify the application to only accept one file at a time.

## Changes Made

### Backend (Electron) Changes

1. **ElectronConversionService.js**
   - Modified the `convertBatch` method to only process the first item in the array
   - Added warning messages about batch processing being disabled
   - Commented out and disabled batch-specific helper methods like `_writeBatchResults`, `_writeContentFileOnly`, `_combineBatchResults`, and `_createBatchSummary`
   - Added clear documentation that batch processing is temporarily disabled

2. **IPC Handlers (conversion/index.js)**
   - Updated the `CONVERT_BATCH` handler to only process the first item
   - Modified the file selection dialog to remove the `multiSelections` property
   - Added warning messages when multiple items are provided
   - Updated the notification handling for batch conversions

3. **Preload.js**
   - Added comments to indicate that batch processing is temporarily disabled
   - Updated documentation for the `convertBatch` method

### Frontend Changes

1. **Client API (client.js)**
   - Added warning messages when multiple items are provided to `convertBatch`
   - Updated documentation to indicate batch processing is disabled

2. **File Converter (fileConverter.js)**
   - Modified the `convertBatch` function to process only the first item instead of throwing an error
   - Added logic to handle different item types (file, URL, parent URL)
   - Updated documentation to indicate batch processing is disabled

3. **Batch Handler (batchHandler.js)**
   - Updated the `processBatch` method to only process the first item
   - Modified the `prepareItems` method to only return the first item
   - Set `canBatchItems` to always return false

4. **UI Components**
   - FileUploader.svelte: Already had logic to only process the first file
   - DropZone.svelte: Already had logic to only take the first file if multiple are dropped
   - NativeFileSelector.svelte: Already had `multiple` prop set to false

5. **Store (files.js)**
   - Already had logic to replace all files with just the new one when adding a file

## Testing Considerations

When testing these changes, verify that:

1. Only one file can be selected at a time
2. If multiple files are somehow provided, only the first one is processed
3. The UI properly indicates that only one file can be processed
4. Conversion works correctly for the single file case
5. No errors occur when attempting to use batch-related functionality

## Future Improvements

When batch processing is re-enabled in the future:

1. Implement proper error handling for batch operations
2. Add progress tracking for individual items in a batch
3. Improve the UI to better display batch conversion status
4. Consider implementing a queue system for large batches
