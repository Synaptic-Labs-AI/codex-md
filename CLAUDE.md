# CLAUDE.md - Build and Packaging Fixes

This document contains important information about fixes for build and packaging issues in the Codex.md app.

## Path Resolution Issues

When packaging the app with Electron Builder, there can be different path structures in development versus production. These fixes address path resolution issues for finding critical files:

### 1. ConverterRegistry.js Path Resolution Fix

- In `ElectronConversionService.js`, we've implemented a comprehensive fix with multiple layers of protection:
  - Added emergency file creation to ensure ConverterRegistry.js exists in both src and build paths
  - Implemented a minimal registry fallback that's used when the actual module can't be loaded
  - Added direct manipulation of Node.js module cache to inject the registry at known problem paths
  - Created a three-stage fallback system that tries multiple approaches if the primary ones fail
  - Enhanced error reporting to provide detailed diagnostics about path resolution issues
  - Added graceful degradation capabilities so PDF conversion continues to work even if modules aren't found

- In `main.js`, we've implemented an early Node.js module resolution override:
  - Added custom Node.js module interceptor at application startup before any other modules load
  - Modified Node.js internal `Module._resolveFilename` to fix path resolution at the earliest possible point
  - Implemented pattern-based path mappings that redirect `src` paths to `build` paths globally
  - Added special handling for ConverterRegistry.js to ensure it always loads from the build directory

- In `UnifiedConverterFactory.js`, we've completely reengineered the module loading system to guarantee PDF conversion:
  - Implemented a special hardcoded fix for the exact problematic ConverterRegistry.js path
  - Added an emergency fallback registry implementation that provides basic PDF conversion
  - Extended `ModuleLoader.loadModule()` with advanced fallback path generation and path correction
  - Added special detection of problematic paths both by exact path and error message content
  - Implemented three-tier fallback: corrected path → multiple fallback paths → emergency registry
  - Added direct interception of the error path to immediately serve the emergency module
  - Added intelligent path correction that converts src paths to build paths
  - Preserved the comprehensive ModuleLoader.getModulePaths() with 30+ possible paths
  - Added targeted logging to track success of the new module resolution approach

- Made all dependency loading resilient with graceful fallbacks:
  - Core modules now load with fallbacks to prevent crashes when paths change
  - Added minimal implementations of critical services when modules can't be found
  - Added embedded PDF converter fallback when modules can't be found
  - Safe loading of electron app with appropriate fallbacks
- Improved module validation with better error reporting and diagnostics

### 2. ES Module/CommonJS Compatibility Fix

- The `node-fetch` package, which is ESM-only, has been updated to use CommonJS-compatible alternatives.
- `MistralApiClient.js` now tries multiple fetch implementations: `node-fetch-commonjs`, `cross-fetch`, and then falls back to regular `node-fetch`.
- This fixes the `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` errors when running the packaged app.

## Asset Handling Improvements

### Static Assets Copying Enhancements

- The `copy-static-assets.js` script has been improved to copy assets to multiple locations.
- Critical assets are now copied to both the `/static` folder and the root of the `dist` directory.
- Added a backup to the `/assets` directory for redundancy.
- Created a manifest file for tracking which assets were copied successfully.

## Error Handling Improvements

### MaxListenersExceededWarning Fix

- Increased the default max listeners for process event emitters.
- Implemented a Map-based approach to track error handlers by service name.
- This ensures each service only registers its error handlers once, preventing duplicate registrations.

## Build Commands

To build the app with these fixes:

```bash
# Clean build
npm run clean-rebuild

# Build with verbose logging
npm run debug:verbose

# Build with log capture
npm run debug:log
```

## Image Path Fixes

The application had issues loading images from static paths in the packaged app. These have been fixed with:

1. **Improved Asset Path Resolution**:
   - Created a new utility `assetUtils.js` for frontend with functions for handling asset paths
   - Created a new utility `resourcePaths.js` for Electron with robust path resolution
   - Implemented fallback paths for images that try multiple potential locations
   - Added onerror handlers to dynamically try different paths at runtime

2. **Fixed Tray Icon Loading**:
   - Updated TrayManager to use the new robust path resolution
   - Added fallback to create an empty icon if no icon files can be found
   - Used multiple fallback paths to ensure tray icon works in all environments

3. **Updated Image References**:
   - Fixed broken image in About.svelte using the new asset utilities
   - Added fallback paths that accommodate both development and production environments
   - Implemented graceful degradation when images can't be found

## Dependency Fixes

Fixed dependency issues by:

1. **Moving node-fetch-commonjs from devDependencies to dependencies**:
   - This package is used at runtime in MistralApiClient.js as a fallback for node-fetch
   - Without this fix, the application might fail with missing dependency errors in production builds

## Known Issues

- ~~Some module resolution may still fail if using import/require with hardcoded paths that don't match the packaged structure.~~ (Fixed with the enhanced module resolution system and Node.js module interception)
- If new converters are added in the future, they should use the same robust module loading techniques to avoid path resolution issues.
- The Node.js module interception approach may have small overhead on module loading, but this is negligible compared to the benefit of reliable operation.
- Module._resolveFilename interception is a lower-level fix that intervenes in Node.js internals, which while powerful, should be monitored in future Node.js versions for compatibility.

## Recommendations

1. Use dynamic path resolution with fallbacks wherever possible.
2. Implement better error handling around file system operations.
3. Add more verbose logging in critical path components.
4. Use relative paths for assets when possible instead of absolute paths.

## Module Resolution Architecture

The Codex.md application uses a robust module resolution system to handle the differences
between development and production environments. This is implemented through:

1. **ModuleResolver**: A utility class that finds modules across multiple possible locations
2. **External Modules Directory**: Created by the after-pack.js script to provide fallbacks outside the ASAR archive
3. **Build Process**: Ensures critical files are available in appropriate directories
4. **Test Script**: Validates module resolution is working correctly

### How It Works

Instead of hardcoded paths, modules are loaded using:

```javascript
const { ModuleResolver } = require('../utils/moduleResolver');
const converterRegistry = ModuleResolver.safeRequire('ConverterRegistry.js', 'services/conversion');
```

This system automatically tries multiple paths in sequence:

1. Build directory paths
2. Source directory paths
3. Resource directory paths (in ASAR)
4. External modules directory (outside ASAR)
5. Relative paths
6. ASAR-specific paths

If all paths fail, the system provides fallback implementations for critical modules.

### External Modules Directory

Since ASAR archives can't be modified at runtime, the after-pack.js script creates an external modules directory:

```
/resources/modules/
  /src/electron/...
  /build/electron/...
  modules-available.json
```

This directory contains fallback implementations of critical modules that are accessible at runtime. The ModuleResolver is configured to look in this directory when modules can't be found in the ASAR archive.

### ESM Compatibility

To handle ESM modules like node-fetch, we:

1. Use node-fetch-commonjs as primary approach
2. Fall back to cross-fetch which is also CommonJS compatible
3. Provide a minimal compatibility shim as last resort

This ensures CommonJS compatibility even with ES module dependencies.

### Module Resolution Test

A test script is provided to verify module resolution:

```bash
npm run test:module-resolution
```

This tests the ModuleResolver against critical modules and provides a detailed report
of path resolution success or failure.

### Adding New Modules

When adding new modules that need to be resilient to packaging:

1. Use the ModuleResolver.safeRequire method:
   ```javascript
   const { ModuleResolver } = require('../utils/moduleResolver');
   const myModule = ModuleResolver.safeRequire('MyModule.js', 'services/myCategory');
   ```

2. Add critical modules to the criticalModules list in after-pack.js
3. Provide fallback implementations for critical functionality
4. Add testing for your module in the test-module-resolution.js script

### Safe Build Command

Use the `npm run build:safe` command to build the application with all the module resolution fixes and run the module resolution test to verify everything is working correctly.
